# Greedy Annealing

- Uses simulated annealing and a greedy algorithm to attempt to solve the Travelling Salesman problem.
- Program attempts to find shortest path between all real-world cities with populations of over 100 000.

- Drawmap.java: Draws a map of the locations of all cities superimposed on a real map.
- PlotTrajectories.java: Plots the best Hamiltonian cycle that the program calculates.
- GreedyAnnealing.java: Configurations for annealing and calculation of best paths.

This implements an algorithm developed by myself to compare the quickness and efficiency of solving the TSP using this method and simulated annealing when given a variable number of points.
