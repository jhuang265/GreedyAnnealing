# TSP-Simulated

- Uses simulated annealing algorithm to attempt to solve the Travelling Salesman problem.
- Program attempts to find shortest path between all real-world cities with populations of over 100 000.

- Drawmap.java: Draws a map of the locations of all cities superimposed on a real map.
- PlotTrajectories.java: Plots the best Hamiltonian cycle that the program calculates.
- GreedyAnnealing.java: Configurations for annealing and calculation of best paths.
